			This website serves as my personal website. It runs on a Tomcat server, and the active content
			is generated through Java code that handles the logic for those pieces. In the tradition
			of the internet, this website aims to be accessible from all web browsers and for all users. 
			If you encounter any accessibility issues, rendering in a text-based browser, connecting to 
			the content with limited sight or mobility, issues of any kind, please contact me through the
			<a href="contact.jsp">Contact Page</a>. I will do my best to help. - DSP
